# Welcome to the Emporium

## About 31st Emporium
Founded by Benson Shiluvani in 2018, 31st Emporium began as a bold vision to empower young South African designers. What started as a college-campus idea quickly grew into a vibrant fashion platform ‚Äî blending boutique elegance with streetwear energy.
From its first store to becoming a nationally recognised brand, 31st Emporium has championed creativity, mentorship, and local pride. With initiatives like the "Designer Spotlight" and a thriving e-commerce presence, it continues to showcase the future of South African fashion.
Motto: "Wear the future. Made in South Africa."
