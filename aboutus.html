<p>History of 31st Emporium</p>
<p>The Story of 31st Emporium</p>
<p>Concept Born: 2015</p>
<p>Founded: 2018</p>
<p>Founder: Benson Shiluvani</p>
<p>Headquarters: South Africa</p>

<br>

<h3>Where Vision Met Opportunity</h3>
<p>The idea for 31st Emporium was first sketched out in 2015, not in a boardroom, but in the buzzing corridors of a college campus. Benson Shiluvani, then a student with a sharp eye for style and an even sharper sense of opportunity, noticed something: talented young designers were creating incredible work — but had no real platform to sell their goods, gain hands-on retail experience, or connect with the world beyond their classrooms.
Benson’s vision was simple yet bold: build a space where emerging designers could showcase their creations, learn the ropes of the fashion business, and have their work discovered by a global audience.</p>

<br>

<h3>From Concept to Catwalk</h3>
<p>In 2018, that vision became reality. The first 31st Emporium store opened its doors, blending the energy of a fashion market with the polish of a high-end boutique. It wasn’t just a shop — it was a launchpad for creativity.
From day one, the store became a magnet for style-seekers looking for something fresh, authentic, and proudly South African. Designers gained not only sales but also mentorship, exposure, and the confidence to grow their brands.</p>
<br>


<h3>Rising to the Top</h3>
<p>Over the years, 31st Emporium has evolved from a single store into one of South Africa’s most respected fashion brands. Its racks have featured everything from bold streetwear to elegant evening pieces, each carrying the signature of a local creative mind.</p>
<p>Key milestones include:</p>
	<ul><li>2019: Launch of the “Designer Spotlight” program, giving monthly features to up-and-coming talent.</li>
	    <li>2021: Expansion into e-commerce, allowing South African designs to reach customers worldwide.</li>
	    <li>2023: Recognition as one of the country’s top fashion destinations by leading lifestyle publications.</li></ul>

        <br>

<h3>Today & Beyond</h3>
<p>Now, 31st Emporium stands as more than a store — it’s a movement. It’s where South African creativity meets global ambition, where every garment tells a story, and where the next generation of designers finds their stage.</p>
<h3>Our Motto: “Wear the future. Made in South Africa.”</h3>

<br>

<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>From concept to fruition, our main aim was to create a place where South African talent can be nurtured and realised. We want to bring designers, creative minds and consumers together to explore the fashion world one piece at a time. We strive to make a platform where each designer can stand loud and proud with the innovation they bring and put the whole world on notice of their immense talent. South African pride is our aim, and championing change through the screen of fashion is our game. There’s more to us than meets the eye.</p>

<p>Our target market is anyone who has an interest in fashion, whether designing it or wearing it. We aim to offer the biggest and best SA brands, and also some from outside. Welcome to the Emporium.</p>
